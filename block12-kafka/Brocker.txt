Since we need to have a broker to act in the middle of the messages that are sent and received,
we dockerized one so we could complete the exercise

docker run --name brokerKafka -p 2181:2181 -p 3030:3030 -p 8081-8083:8081-8083 -p 9581-9585:9581-9585 -p 9092:9092 -e ADV_HOST=localhost landoop/fast-data-dev:latest
